# Clang-Identifiers-To-Retrieve-The-Mangled-Name

This project enhances the Clang compiler by introducing two new identifiers: fq_func and mangled_func. The primary goal is to enable the retrieval of both fully qualified and mangled function names during compilation. fq_func retrieves the fully qualified name of a function, including namespaces and class names, while mangled_func retrieves the function's mangled name generated by the LLVM backend. Test cases were implemented to validate the correct behavior of these identifiers in various contexts, including different namespaces and class hierarchies, ensuring robust and accurate functionality within the compiler.
